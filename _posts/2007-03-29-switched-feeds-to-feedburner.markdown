title: Switched feeds to FeedBurner

I've switched my feeds at this blog to be published via
[FeedBurner](http://www.feedburner.com/). There should be no disruption to
your normal reading, although some aggregators might show some non-new items
as new.

The WP [plugin](http://orderedlist.com/wordpress-plugins/feedburner-plugin/)
really made it a breeze.
