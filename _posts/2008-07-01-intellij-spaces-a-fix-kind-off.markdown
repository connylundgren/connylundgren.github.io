title: IntelliJ & Spaces, a fix (kind off)
comments: true

This isn't exactly new, but some java-apps seem to have problems with Spaces
in Leopard, i.e. not changing to the correct spaces when switching program.

I found a pretty easy solution, simply open the help window and put it behind
the main IDEA window, spaces works fine (although this is kind of hacky).
