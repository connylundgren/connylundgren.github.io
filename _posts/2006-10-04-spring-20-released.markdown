Spring 2.0 were
[released](http://www.theserverside.com/news/thread.tss?thread_id=42460)
today, I guess the real question is it worth upgrading now or wait a while? I
have been somewhat absent from the whole 2.0 release, and only glanced the new
features and it seams like a good release well worth a major version bump.
